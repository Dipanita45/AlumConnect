## üîß The Contribution Workflow

### 4\. Create a New Branch

Never work directly on the `main` branch. Create a descriptive branch name based on the work you're doing.

**Branch Naming Prefixes:**

  * `feat/`: for a new feature (e.g., `feat/user-profile-picture`)
  * `fix/`: for a bug fix (e.g., `fix/login-button-alignment`)
  * `docs/`: for documentation changes (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
  * `chore/`: for maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`)

<!-- end list -->

```bash
# Example for a new feature
git checkout -b feat/add-event-reminders
```

### 5\. Make Your Changes

Write your code, fix the bug, or improve the documentation. Remember to follow the existing code style to maintain consistency.

### 6\. Commit Your Changes

We follow the [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for our commit messages. This makes our project history clean and easy to read.

**Commit Message Format:** `<type>: <subject>`

```bash
# Good commit message examples
git commit -m "feat: Add password reset functionality"
git commit -m "fix: Correct typo in alumni login error message"
git commit -m "docs: Update contributing guidelines with testing info"
```

### 7\. Push to Your Fork

Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feat/add-event-reminders
```

### 8\. Open a Pull Request (PR)

Go to the original AlumConnect repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a pull request from your new branch. Click it and fill out the PR template.

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Guidelines

  * **Keep PRs focused.** Each PR should address a single issue or feature.
  * **Provide a clear description.** Explain *what* your PR does and *why* it's needed.
  * **Reference related issues.** If your PR fixes an open issue, use a keyword like `Closes #123` in the description.
  * **Ensure all checks pass.** Your PR must pass any automated checks (like linting or tests) before it can be merged.

To help you, we use a pull request template. Please fill it out as completely as possible.
